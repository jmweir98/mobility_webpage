        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <hr class="custom-hr">
        <p class="about-paragraph">At Mobility Matters, our mission is deeply personal and profoundly impactful. As a spinal cord injury patient, I understand firsthand the challenges of navigating life with mobility limitations. My journey has led me to become an advocate for increasing awareness about the importance of suitable mobility aids. I am dedicated to sharing valuable information and resources to help others in similar situations find the right solutions that enhance their independence and quality of life. Through this platform, I aim to shed light on innovative products and assistive technologies that can make a meaningful difference. My goal is to empower individuals with spinal cord injuries and their families by providing them with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about mobility aids. Together, we can foster a more inclusive and accessible world.</p>
